            <i>December 1, 2224 –</i> Today, the Luten Family Foundation announced the launch of Infinity Garden, a
            virtual
            interface featuring interactive exhibits of flora from around the world.<br>

            Amidst the rarity of physical ornamental plants that once proliferated prior to climate-induced mass dieback
            and associated restrictions on private gardens, the project aims to make the beauty of a vibrant,
            well-manicured garden accessible to individuals of all income levels and geographic locations.<br>

            In line with the Luten family’s commitment to sustainable energy consumption, Infinity Garden maintains
            carbon neutrality in spite of its extensive scope using heirloom technology and patented sustainability
            techniques developed by Luten Energy.<br>

            It is through the tireless conservation efforts and generosity of the Luten family that this digital
            botanical archive exists and is free and accessible to the public via any personal computing device [Amad

                “My father’s lifelong vision of democratizing access to plant life of all varieties for a population
                that is frequently starved of beauty and respite from our chaotic modern world has been realized with
                the opening of Infinity Garden,”</i> said Patrick Luten, President emeritus of Luten Energy and Chief
            Operating Officer of the Luten Family Foundation. <i>“We welcome you to Infinity Garden, and hope that our
                digital interface will allow you to explore and nurture virtual biodiversity by exploring numerous

            Notably, the garden prides itself on being labor-free in line with recent economic guidelines for privately
            funded recreational facilities, and its staffing consists entirely of artificial intelligence, namely the
            groundskeeper PAT, who owes his namesake to the fictional gardener from prominent 19th century author Lewis
            Carroll’s 1865 book, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.<br><br>
