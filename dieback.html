    <h2>22nd C. DIEBACK</h2>

      22nd C. DIEBACK By the end of the 21st century, Phragmites
      australis, the canary in the coalmine of the Southeastern
      coastal wetlands had exhibited extensive dieback in regional
      river deltas. Sometimes this mass death took the form of a
      blight, visible in patches of fungus or necrosis induced by a
      pathogen. Such pathogens proliferated as climate change impacted
      the migratory patterns of birds, insects and other fauna. Other
      times, particularly in cases of extreme heat, plants simply grew
      brown and dry before expiring due to extreme heat and dryness.
      The trend extended to numerous plant species in the region, then
      beyond the wetlands into other biomes across the continent. Even
      the most heat-tolerant and drought-resistant species of
      cactaceae were not equipped to survive. Persistent loss of plant
      diversity both spelled and evinced the climate crisis that
      characterized the 22nd century.<br><br>

      Researchers estimated that a global loss of plant diversity
      could have resulted in the release of up to 149 billion metric
      tons of carbon from vegetation in 2085, the equivalent of more
      than 12 additional years of global car emissions. Even
      biodiversity hotspots – South America, Central Africa, and
      Southeast Asia – experienced significant species loss and carbon
      storage declines. Ecologists recommended restorative measures be
      initiated as soon as possible to minimize erosion of the soil
      and climate-induced mass dieback. The ever-creeping loss of
      productive and valuable ecosystems created irrevocable shifts in
      the global economy, necessitating a complete restructuring of
      our food and textile industries, as well as the elective
      technology available to the public. Decorative gardens became a
      luxury, then a rarity, and then were ultimately banned for
      private citizens in 2146 in order to conserve resources.<br /><br>
